Hi,

In an effort to help reducing the amount of boiler plates to start a new Advent of Code day in ruby. To use this, every day, copy the `day-0` folder and paste the test and input from the challenge.
Good luck and have fun.

P.s: feel free to make any suggestions and improvements as you see fit. I am not very familiar with Ruby yet, so this is very primital.
